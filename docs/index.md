## For AI Agents

When working on this codebase:

1. **Theme is Orange** - not Indigo (V2 references are outdated)
2. **Use aliases** - `@/lib/utils` not relative paths
3. **NavLink for navigation** - not button onClick
4. **Validate Convex** - run `pnpm dev:backend` after changes
5. **Check DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md** - for styling decisions
