## Architecture Overview

### Repository Type: **Monolith**

Single cohesive codebase with frontend and backend in the same repository.

```
invoice-collection-assistant/
├── src/                 # React Frontend
├── convex/              # Convex Backend
├── specs/               # Feature Specifications (V2, V3)
├── docs/                # Generated Documentation
└── _bmad-output/        # BMM Planning Artifacts
```

### Architecture Pattern

- **Frontend:** Component-based SPA with React Router
- **Backend:** Serverless functions with Convex (queries, mutations, actions)
- **State Management:** Convex real-time hooks (`useQuery`, `useMutation`)
- **Data Flow:** Client → Convex Functions → Database (real-time sync)

## Domain Model

The application manages the invoice collection lifecycle:

### Core Entities

1. **Organizations** - Companies using the system
2. **Users** - Team members (admins and technicians)
3. **Invoices** - Invoices with 3-dimensional status tracking
4. **Reminders** - Scheduled follow-up actions (email/phone)
5. **Payments** - Payment records with partial payment support
6. **Events** - Activity timeline for auditing

### Invoice Status Dimensions

| Dimension | States | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Send Status** | pending, sent | Whether invoice was sent to client |
| **Payment Status** | unpaid, partial, pending_payment, paid | Payment state |
| **Reminder Status** | reminder_1-4, manual_followup | Follow-up progression |
